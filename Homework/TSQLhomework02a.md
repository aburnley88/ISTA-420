2. The FROM clause is you specify the names of the table you want to query.

3. In the WHERE clause, you specify a predicate or logical expression to filter the rows
returned by the FROM phase. Only rows for which the logical expression evaluates to
TRUE are returned by the WHERE phase.

4. Use the GROUP BY phase to arrange the rows returned by the previous logical query
processing phase in groups.

5. The Having clause is a group filter. Only groups for which the HAVING predicate evaluates to
TRUE are returned by the HAVING phase to the next logical query processing phase.

6. SELECT clause is where you specify the attributes(columns) you want to return in the
result table of the query.

7. The DISTINCT clause is a way to remove duplicates.

8. The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the rows in the output for presentation purposes.

9. The LIMIT clause is used to set an upper limit on the number of tuples returned.

10. The TOP filter is a feature used to limit the number of percentage of rows
a query returns.

11. OFFSET-FETCH is a TOP-like filter that supports a skipping option.
With the OFFSET clause you indicate how many rows to skip, and with the FETCH clause
you indicate how many rows to filter after the skipped rows.
