#Project Exercise 1
##Arnold Burnley
###July 5th, 2020


  My name is Arnold Burnley, and I'm 31 years old from San Diego California.
I have had a slew of app ideas over the last few years but no technical skills
to build the apps, nor have I known exactly where to begin at all for my apps to
see any sort of light of day. My objective for this project is to highlight my
skills as a visionary and innovator. Additionally, I aim to absorb as much as I can
from the activities that will be conducive to one day building these ideas and others.
These activities include but are not limited to: the application development lifecycle,
conducting a requirements analysis, building the database, and many more.

  My first project idea would be a public database. The database would gather and collect
information from all elected officials at every level of government in the U.S.,.
The information collected would be all of their public speeches, debates, donors,
political affiliation, media mentions, social media profiles, and anything else relevant
or demanded by the users. The application would give citizens a much better avenue
of understanding the political landscape and therefore more power to seek change from the bottom.
It would be nice if when there is a sensitive social issue people launch there app and email
the people who can make change immediately.

  Accountability is one of the best part of the application. Suppose an
elected official gets a new position and begins to change their stance or begin
to go back on their word. With this application in place users would be able to go
through the politicians archives sorted by issue and see for themselves what the
official has said and when they said it and who reported it. In addition to these
features there is one other I would want. Around election time news agencies make
many statements based off mock polls. A mock voting feature would be a great way to
actually ascertain how much influence your politician has.

  My 2nd application idea is as large scale as the first, but it seeks to tackle
another American issue: the economy and the work force. This idea is similar to
Craigslist in the sense that users post jobs that they need done and other users
fill those jobs in exchange for money. However my idea is far more expansive. Every
user would have a "resume" page that shows all of the jobs they've completed, their
ratings, and any comments left by "employers". Users that post jobs will also have an
employer page listing all the jobs they've posted and what they paid as well as comments
from "employees" and if the employer left a tip on the job. These "jobs" could be anything
from doing someone's oil change for them to washing their dishes. Ideally, unemployed people
could wake up open their app and start bidding on work. A user could do a few dishes, walk some dogs,
and remove bulk trash all in a days work and still feel like a contributing member of society.

  The other side of the app is the ability to genuinely gauge the economy. My theory is
that there is never s short of work. There is  institutionalized racism, sexism, nepotism,
and other unfortunate barriers to everyone having a fair shot. The app would show how much
money is being moved around each day, which areas have the highest value jobs, and areas where
the "market" is saturated.

  My 3rd application idea is very cool. I would like to build an app that creates "horoscopes" for
  the user.  These aren't based on astrology, however. The application is like a personal journal
  for the user. Users would be able to quickly put in their emotional states with the option to
  write more as to why they are feeling the way they are feeling, but the point is to capture the mood.
  Naturally the app would collect the weather at the time of the entry, the moon phase and position, as well
  as the time. After a bit of collecting the app would begin to tell you stats:

  "you are happiest when the weather is fair and the moon is waning. This waning moon the weather is snowy
  and with this combination you are usually feeling introspective and spiritual".

  The app is limited by user input but the more they stored the more the app could do for them. With user permission
  the application would compare their information with similar users:

  "Other programmers are saying that _________ is very funny. For the last 2 days you have been moody
  care to brighten up?"

  I will achieve my personal objectives by committing to the project and putting a lot into them. From what I read
we aren't expected to actually build the app, but I would like to try to build something small scale. For my first idea
I could stick to my city just to see how the app works, and for the second I would prefer to get to know the idea more deeply
so that I can explain it better and determine how I could get it built. The 3rd app my objective is to learn how it could be done.
It seems like the simplest app.
